**NOTE:** This markdown cheatsheet is a typography demo for this theme. Check out this post to learn more about this markdown usage when you want to get started with this theme. Enjoy!

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

<div class="divider"></div>

## Headings H1 to H6

# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

#### H4 Heading

##### H5 Heading

###### H6 Heading

<div class="divider"></div>

## Footnote

Let's say you have text that you want to refer with a footnote, you can do that too! This is an example for the footnote number one [^1]. You can even add more footnotes, with link! [^2]

<div class="divider"></div>

## Blockquote

> Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. --Francis of Assisi

**NOTE:** This theme does NOT support nested blockquotes.

<div class="divider"></div>

## List Items

1. First order list item
2. Second item

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

<div class="divider"></div>
